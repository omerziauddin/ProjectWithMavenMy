download 2 dependencies for second level caching
   1-  ehcache maven
   2-  hibernate ehcache maven(its version must be same as your hibernate version see in pom
   3-  add two properties in hiberncate cfg file
       <property name="cache.use_second_level_cache">true</property>
		<property name="org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.internal.EhcacheRegionFactory</property>
        
   4- use these annotations on entity class which u want to enable second level caching
     here its student class 
     @Cacheable
     @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_ONLY)
     
     read only is for reading operations
     
    output

    select
        student0_.id as id1_5_0_,
        student0_.course as course2_5_0_,
        student0_.duration as duration3_5_0_,
        student0_.city as city4_5_0_,
        student0_.name as name5_5_0_ 
    from

Student [id=1234, name=peter, city=Delhi]
Student [id=1234, name=peter, city=Delhi]
